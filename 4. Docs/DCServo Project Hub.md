# DCServo Project Hub

**Objective:** To design, build, and validate a high-performance, open-source controller for brushed DC and coreless motors. The project will serve as the hardware platform for a bachelor's thesis on advanced motor control, system identification, and Model Predictive Control (MPC).

### Current Priorities
- [ ] Finalize system requirements in [[ENV-DCServo]].
- [ ] Select and document the final choice for the motor gate driver [[ADR-XXX_Gate_Driver]].
- [ ] Begin PCB layout for the Low Power V2 board [[SPEC-LP-V2]].

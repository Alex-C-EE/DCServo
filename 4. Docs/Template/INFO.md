### Abstract
[Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of the document's purpose and scope. e.g., "This document presents the state-space model of a 12V coreless DC motor and the results of a Simulink simulation of its response to a step input under a PID control loop. The simulation was used to validate the controller gains before hardware testing."]

### Key Findings
* [e.g., The derived PID gains (Kp=X, Ki=Y, Kd=Z) result in a simulated rise time of 50ms with <2% overshoot.]
* [e.g., The model shows current saturation at 4.5A during initial acceleration, which must be handled by the firmware's current limiting feature.]
* [e.g., Simulation results are attached in the source PDF.]
